test upstream (my understanding: upstream is the alias of the base repository)


create some conflicts here

is my understanding correct? 

yes, my understanding is correct. upstream is the alias of the source repository (https://github.com/stephenchenxj/learn_git) where the current remote repository (https://github.com/hssdiy/learn_git) is forked from.
either upstream, or the full url address could be used to tell git where to pull the code.

updated in branch_test.
